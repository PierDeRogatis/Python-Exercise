# Python-Exercise

In this repository, I will deposit the exercises done in different online learning platforms. I focused on Python, especially for its usefulness as a Data Science programming language. 

I will deposit the exercised and projects created thanks to the MIMO App divided in three parts. MIMO is described as the most accessible and effective way to learn to code in Python, with its programming lessons and practice coding exercises suitable for everyone. MIMO was also awarded the Google Play's Editor Choice and the Best Self-Improvement Apps of 2018. MIMO curriculum is built by professionals, focusing on real-world projects. For this reason, I will upload here the coding challenges and projects developed through MIMO.

I will also upload the projects that I had to make with in the Learn Python (Python X) platform. With hundred of code examples, it is perfect for starting to learn Python and creates the background for more advanced skills.
